# ML-PHA Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict the yield of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) â€” a sustainable, biodegradable biopolymer â€” from wastewater-based fermentation processes. Leveraging Random Forest Regression, it models key parameters such as temperature, pH, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio to optimize biopolymer production.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
